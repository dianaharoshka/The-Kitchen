# The Kitchen – School Project

This project was developed collaboratively as part of the **Web Development for E-commerce** course. The application is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **SASS**. It simulates a restaurant website featuring booking and administration functionality.

## 🧩 Features

### Public Pages

- **Home Page** – Introduction to the restaurant and concept.
- **Booking Page** – Visitors can:
  - Select a date and time (18:00 or 21:00).
  - Enter name, email, and number of guests (up to 6 per table).
  - Book one of 15 available tables (2 sittings per evening).

- **Contact Page** – Contact information for the restaurant.

### Admin Page

- Intended to allow staff to view and manage all bookings.
- Planned functionality includes adding, editing, and deleting bookings using modal dialogs.
- **Note:** The Admin Page is currently under development and not fully functional.
